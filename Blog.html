        SÃ¶ren, from Denmark, 2016:
      </h3>
      It was a GREAT time. I learned to scuba dive and met nice
volunteers from all over the world.
The team is fantastic, Philipp in particular showed me a lot of
things. I have decided! I will study marine biology in
Copenhagen.

        Naomi, from South Africa, 2018:
      </h3>
      This time changed my life. I found many new friends. I love the
      underwater world and was amazed by the sea turtles.
      I'll be back next year. Volunteering is great!
    </p>

        Carlos, from Brazil, 2020:
      </h3>
      It was a special time for me in Barcelona. Marine conservation
      is important around the world. I had already worked on the
      Brazilian coast and picked up garbage.
      During the 2 weeks I looked at the situation in Europe.
      I took a lot of important information with me to Brazil. I got
      along very well with Juanito. He was very funny
    </p>

        Marc, from Canada, 2021:
      </h3>
      This experience was great, fantastic and special! Luckily I
      decided to do this project. The volunteer work and working
      with Christopher and Lucas was very successful.
